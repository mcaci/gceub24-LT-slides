# My message

We all have good Go game and we know how to write simple and effective Go, but how about kicking it up a notch? Let's see how the standard library can level up our Go game with the treasures in its packages and make our Go game even stronger.

Additional information -> With this proposal I want to showcase at most three usecases from the standard that can help our daily life while writing Go code:

1) How to manage data transfer with the io package: from io.Copy vs io.ReadAll up to the io.Pipe and io.MultiWriter;
2) How to manage error creation from the fmt package to the errors package, from the verbs "%s", "%v" and "%w" up to the errors.Join;
3) How to manage efficiently slices and maps operations witht the use of the generic functions in the slices and maps packages;

I know it's a lot of content for the lightning talk and I will be very careful at the end in selecting which of these items I will present but I'm confident that it will give to other gophers some inspiration in going out of the box yet still in the standard library to discover all the powerful tools it provides. I plan to use just a slideshow since the time is short.

# Gem 1

How to manage data transfer with the io package: from io.Copy vs io.ReadAll up to the io.Pipe and io.MultiWriter;

<v-click>
Let's see the transfer a message to one destination chat application
</v-click>

<v-click>

````md magic-move {lines: true}
```go {all|2}
// Read all input then write it
b, err := io.ReadAll(in)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
w.Write(b)
```


```go {2|all}
// copy the input from the src to the dst
_, err := io.Copy(dst, src)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
```
````
</v-click>


<v-click>
How about transferring the message to multiple destinations?
</v-click>

<v-click>
````md magic-move {lines: true}
```go {all|2|all}
// Read all input then write it
b, err := io.ReadAll(in)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
w1.Write(b)
w2.Write(b)
```


```go {all|2|all}
// list all writers you need to write to with io.MultiWriter
dsts := io.MultiWriter(dst1, dst2, dst3)
// then copy the input from the src to the dst
_, err := io.Copy(dsts, src)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
```
````
</v-click>

<!-- Imagine I'm writing a chat application and I want to transfer a message to a person, a common way to do it is to read it and transfer it again -->

# Gem #2

How to manage error creation from the fmt package to the errors package, from the verbs "%s", "%v" and "%w" up to the errors.Join;

Errors: we all love them

We started creating them with errors.New and fmt.Errorf.

But most commonly with fmt.Errorf you can still see the usage of %s and %v to relate to the error. Not good.

But then again %w was only introduced in 2019 (with [v1.13](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.13#error_wrapping))... so 4 years ago.

For those who don't yet know %w indicates the wrapping of an error, but since early 2023 (with [v1.20](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.20#errors)) the possibility to wrap multiple errors was introduced.

Which is great! But how do we do this? `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w: %w", err1, err2, err3)`, `fmt.Errorf("err1 %w; err2 %w; err3 %w", err1, err2, err3)`...

Let's have this solved by `errors.Join(err1, err2, err3)`

It is important to be able the error, but also from the application it is important to have it clear that one error can be one or several others. (application does not care of the formatting)

# Gem #3

How to manage efficiently slices and maps operations with the use of the generic functions in the slices and maps packages;

I have been working in an application that works as a proxy server between client sending http requests, manipulates them and forwards them to the intended target. And one of the main job was to manipate an `http.Header` which in Go is simply a `map[string][]string`.

```go
func update(h html.Header, toAdd html.Header, to delete []string {}
```

Since [v1.21](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.21#library) we can use the maps, slices packages to do operations in maps and slices thanks to generics.

Before that you had to manipulate the code by hand

```go
make exaple in go
```

# Table of contents

You can use the `Toc` component to generate a table of contents for your slides:

```html
<Toc minDepth="1" maxDepth="1"></Toc>
```

The title will be inferred from your slide content, or you can override it with `title` and `level` in your frontmatter.

# Shiki Magic Move

Powered by [shiki-magic-move](https://shiki-magic-move.netlify.app/), Slidev supports animations across multiple code snippets.

Add multiple code blocks and wrap them with <code>````md magic-move</code> (four backticks) to enable the magic move. For example:

````md magic-move {lines: true}
```ts {*|2|*}
// step 1
const author = reactive({
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
})
```

```ts {*|1-2|3-4|3-4,8}
// step 2
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      author: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        books: [
          'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
          'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
          'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
// step 3
export default {
  data: () => ({
    author: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      books: [
        'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
        'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
        'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
      ]
    }
  })
}
```

Non-code blocks are ignored.

```vue
<!-- step 4 -->
<script setup>
const author = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
}
</script>
```

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/builtin/components.html) for more.

# Themes

Slidev comes with powerful theming support. Themes can provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter:

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">

```yaml
---
theme: default
---
```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph
---
```

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-default/01.png?raw=true" alt="">

# Clicks Animations

You can add `v-click` to elements to add a click animation.

<div v-click>

This shows up when you click the slide:

```html
<div v-click>This shows up when you click the slide.</div>
```

</div>

<br>

<v-click>

The <span v-mark.red="3"><code>v-mark</code> directive</span>
also allows you to add
<span v-mark.circle.orange="4">inline marks</span>
, powered by [Rough Notation](https://roughnotation.com/):

```html
<span v-mark.underline.orange>inline markers</span>
```

</v-click>

# Monaco Editor

Slidev provides built-in Monaco Editor support.

Add `{monaco}` to the code block to turn it into an editor:

```ts {monaco}
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray } from './external'

const arr = ref(emptyArray(10))
```

Use `{monaco-run}` to create an editor that can execute the code directly in the slide:

```ts {monaco-run}
import { version } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray, sayHello } from './external'

sayHello()
console.log(`vue ${version}`)
console.log(emptyArray<number>(10).reduce(fib => [...fib, fib.at(-1)! + fib.at(-2)!], [1, 1]))
